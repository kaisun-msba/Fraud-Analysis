# Fraud-Analysis

This repo contains all homeworks from Fraud Analytics (omitting course number here in case future students look for the class). 

There are three projects:

- Find Anomalies in NY Property Data. About a million property records with about 32 fields. Many records have missing fields. Build an unsupervised algorithm that can look through their  ~million property records to find potential tax fraud. Here is a little information about the NY data: (https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72129500/168513072-59a1bd40-37e9-4350-a6c9-809a306147ee.png)


- Build a Real-Time Application Fraud Algorithm. Used 1,000,000 records of synthetic applications data (PII data). Supervised Models. 


- Build a supervisedÂ fraud model on the card transaction data. There were bout 96,000 records, ~1,000 frauds.
